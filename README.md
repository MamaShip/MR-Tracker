Currently only work for Gitlab MRs.

## Usage

### Before

This tool works on Gitlab APIs. Make sure your gitlab project visibility is **public**, OR generate a `private-token` (see [Gitlab docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html)) for your project.

And the **project ID** is required for Gitlab APIs to work. You can find it from your project home page:

go install github.com/MamaShip/MR-Tracker@latest
```
